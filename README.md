I seem to be drawn most to the following 
##Aptana Studio 3##
URL: http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download.html


It is the professional, open source development tool for the open web,__Perhaps the most powerful of the open source IDEs__, __Aptana Studio 3__is a massive improvement over its predecessors. Since Aptana Studio 3 supports most browser specs, compatibility challenges are minimal, so users can quickly develop, test and deploy web apps from this single IDE.

Languages Supported: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, PHP, and Python

Some key features:

    HTML, CSS and JavaScript code assist
    Deployment wizard
    Integrated Debuggers for Ruby for Rails and JavaScript
    Git Integration
    User-friendly full IDE customization
    Integrated intelligent Syntax highlighting
    Rich set of community provided Plugins

Drawbacks: Although Aptana works well for students juggling multiple small projects, it has stability issues and runs slowly, so professional developers might prefer a more powerful IDE.
